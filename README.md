## Overview
This repository is used for week 3 challenge of 10Academy. The instructions for this project can be found in the challenge document.

## Scenario
You work at Rossmann Pharmaceuticals as a Machine Learning Engineer. The finance team
wants to forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time.

The data team identified factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays,
seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting the sales across the various stores.

Your job is to build and serve an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to analysts
in the finance team.

- Exploration of customer purchasing behavior
